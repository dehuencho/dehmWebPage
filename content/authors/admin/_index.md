I have worked in the transport industry for the last 3 years, developing machine
learning models with strong basis in statistics and creating tools that a allow my
organization to deliver a better service to the 2.5 million people that travel per
day in the Santiago’s subways network. I’m passionate about creating value
from data with different tools like Python and R. I firmly believe in maintaining a
healthy body for a good life, so exercise and training my mind are central pillars
on my day-to-day activities.
